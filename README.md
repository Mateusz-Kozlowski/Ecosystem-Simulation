# Ecosystem-Simulation

Before I started the project I had thought that it's all about kinematics and I'll finish the project in one day.
After a couple of months I realised that making the program working properly requires implementing quanta of energy like in modern physics.
Now I'm working on other projects and perhaps I'll return to this one once I'll gain more coding knowledge and experience.

There is also an issue with compiling the project. I'll fix it someday.
