Before I started the project I had thought that it's all about kinematics and I'll finish the project in one day.
After a couple of months I realised that making the program working properly requires implementing quanta of energy like in modern physics (I didn't know about issues with floating-point numbers in programming)

## Features
I'm going to gradually add here the features of the project:

* pressing F key during simulation prints the smallest and the biggest fruit energy
* by holding Z key you are able to zoom out the camera so that you can see what is beyond the world
