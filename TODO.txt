rename individual with animal!!!
add nn viewer class and then (probably) rmv rendering component class
moving te panel so that it's never beyond the world
change activation functions
create ecosystem with more fooood
random start positions
add hp gui
add hp, which is connected to the gui, and movement component (P = k * sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2) * sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2))
add dying
how to connect dying with std::vector of individuals? pointers of individuals? 
	and swaping the last individual with the dying one? maybe...
food should occur in world borders :)
