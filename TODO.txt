The smaller number the greater priority (the sooner that thing should be implemented)

1:
implement God tools
better nearest food searching algo (with complexity better than the current one (O(f*a)))
new energy system
NeuralNetPreview class should be a member of Ecosystem class, not a member of Animal class
rebuild the program structure at ecosystem and animals level (rewrite Ecosystem && Animal classes)
cloning while eating
new food creation while dying (from kinethic energy) (a random place or the place of death?)
if there is no food the program crashes! (it's not surprising :))

2:
rename food to fruit/fruits?
some GUI widgets positions are set relative to their centers and some are set relative to their upper-left corners... =>
	=> fix that!
	=> maybe allow to choose both ways of setting positions?...
use EventsAccessors class wherever possible (including GUI classes)
debug showing brain while a simulation is paused (brain renders probably in the previous position)
update brain after stopping (and probably also after replacing and maybe others (there are no others... probably))
use that tricky way of dealing with event (not necessarily passing reference, but using utility from State) everywhere
convention of names in tools (->replace is also called move and it shouldn't have 2 names)(->track and select also)
	(rmv and delete? I used remove everywhere, but delete may be a better option)
loading "from main menu" (loading state will be neccessairly)
add consts to renders where it is possible (and also to other places)
what with hp rendering? Does it have bool like nn preview? Do ecosystem control check that bool? I don't think so...
input field outline should be inside, not outside
default positions of animals shouldn't be [0, 0] also by default their bodies are white, they should be red
new texture for brain hiding?
use sf::Vector2<T> instead of 2 floats
Shortcuts/about state
fix bug with preventing from going beyond the world (not change a sign of a vector but make it correct)
saving  "from main menu" (loading state will be neccessairly)
smart pointers!
set text function in Button class change string of sf::Text member, but doesn't "recenter" it, should this happen? =>
	=> Rewrite some GUI classes at all. =>
		=> events to gui elements and so on...
		=> and is clicked should use mouse pressed instead of released, but it should also prevent repeating clicks
define states freezing
keys editor (Did I mean keybinds?)
nn viewer never beyond the world
random starts positions? I guess... no, because I think that this "Big Bang" efect is great!
Species class
textures (different) and hitbox component
editor state (for or ecosystem or for animal? or maybe for both of them? maybe...) =>
check if the string of that text in the left-top corner makes sense
sexual reproduction...

3:
Crappy Neural Nets! =>
	=> NEAT REAL TIME
	since using NEAT:
		brains preview in side panel/menu and next to the animals
	=> <random> library? Check it out!
