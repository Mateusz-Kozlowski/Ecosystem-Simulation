The smaller number the greater priority (the sooner that thing should be implemented)

1:
better nearest food searching algo (with complexity better than the current one (O(f*a)))
	or maybe even different inputs
rebuild the program structure at ecosystem and animals level (rewrite Ecosystem && Animal classes)
new "ecosystem creation state"
"precreated ecosystems examples" in ecosystem creation state
side menu should be able to be opened not only using Esc key but also using a gui widget that doesn't even exist now
dt can be extremelly big if a window lost the focus

shortcuts:
	speeding up and slowing down
	moving side panel
	God tools

saving zoom/world camera can be useful

2:
DEBUG:
	debug showing brain while a simulation is paused (brain renders probably in the previous position)
	tunneling
	update brain after stopping (and probably also after replacing and maybe others (there are no others... probably))

STATES:
	shortcuts/keys state

GUI:
	one convention for all gui widgets, meybe even polimorphizm
	some GUI widgets positions are set relative to their centers and some are set relative to their 
		upper-left corners... =>
			=> fix that!
			=> maybe allow to choose both ways of setting positions?...
	
CONVENTION/NAMES/COMMENTS/CODE:
	convention of names in tools (->replace is also called move and it shouldn't have 2 names)(->track and select also)
		(rmv and delete? I used remove everywhere, but delete may be a better option)
	add consts to renders where it is possible (and also to other places)
	use sf::Vector2<T> instead of 2 floats
	smart pointers!

OTHERS:
	implement info tool (probably it'll be able to give info not only about the entire ecosystem
		but also about particular animals if they are tracked at the moment or sth :) )
	use EventsAccessors class wherever possible (including GUI classes)
	define states freezing
	nn viewer should never beyond the world
	textures (different) and hitbox component
	use real copy constructors (remember about the rule of three!)	
	sexual reproduction...

3:
Crappy Neural Nets! =>
	=> NEAT REAL TIME
	since using NEAT:
		brains preview also in side panel/menu and next to the animals
	=> <random> library? Check it out!
