slowing down and speeding up a simulation
fix bug with preventing from going beyond the world (not change a sign of a vector but make it correct)
add consts to renders where it is possible (and also to other places)
add nn viewer class and then (probably) rmv rendering component class
viewer and hp bar classes should be members of animal objects, but animal should have multiple rendering functions
	(instead of one big render function like in almost all other classes in the project)
moving te panel so that it's never beyond the world
change activation functions
random start positions
make sure that a food isn't eaten twice (or even worse)
	(2 individuals can reach a food at the same which can cause an issue)
non 0 brain inputs:
	vx (can be negative)
	vy (can be negative)
	x distance to the nearest food (can be negative)
	y distance to the nearest food (can be negative)
	hp
center neurons "in vertical way"
weights in visualization (alfa-color style, ykwim)
hiding neurons and weight if there is to many ... neurons in a layers
loading "from main menu" (loading state will be neccessairly)
saving  "from main menu" (loading state will be neccessairly)
check if the string of that text in the left-top corner makes sense
change pause menu (maybe buttons like hide all brains/hp bars (and show) and so on)
	show/hide all simply goes to all animals and sets its bool's to true/false =>
	=> action of showing/hiding is irreversible (u cannot EASLY go to the previous state, 
	where e.g half of hp bars were shown, you can only return that state manually)
smart pointers!
cloning
Species class
textures (different) and hitbox component
editor state?
add a better way of dealing with random numbers generator
add open file explorer button! (if it will be needed)
way if a user clicked load button without creating a new ecosystem in creator state?
God hand - interventions like replacing using mouse and so on...
sexual reproduction
Crappy Neural Nets!
